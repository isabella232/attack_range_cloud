# Splunk Cloud Attack Range ‚öîÔ∏è

## Purpose üõ°
The Cloud Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering. First, the user is able to build quickly a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a cloud environment. Second, the Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as [Leonidas](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/leonidas) in order to generate real attack data. Third, it integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.  

## Building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Attack Range can be built in three different ways:

- **cloud-only**, this project
- **cloud** using terraform and AWS, see [attack\_range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range)
- **locally** with vagrant and virtualbox, see [attack\_range\_local](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range_local/)



## Architecture üèØ
The Cloud Attack Range consists of:
- pre-configured Splunk server with AWS Cloudtrail logs and Kubernetes logs
- pre-configured Phantom server
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service with a Wordpress app and [Splunk Connect for Kubernetes](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes)
- integrated [Leonidas](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/leonidas) cloud attacks

### Logging
The following log sources are collected from the machines:
- Cloudtrail logs (```index=aws```)
- Kubernetes logs (```index=kubernetes```)
- Kubernetes metrics (```index=kubernetes-metrics```)
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service logs (```index=aws sourcetype=aws:cloudwatchlogs```)

## Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
